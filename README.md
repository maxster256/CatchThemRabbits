# CatchThemRabbits
A simple multi-threaded Java app simulating a wolf that is trying to catch all of the rabbits running on the board. Coded as a task for the university, using some JavaFX and basic Java Thread capabilities.

## Usage
It's possible to change the size of the board (number of columns and rows), size of the fields (width/height), count of the rabbits and the time it takes for the wolf to "eat" the rabbit.
